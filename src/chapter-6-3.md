Innovation is a powerful driver of business growth, but to harness its full potential, you must be able to measure its impact effectively. In this chapter, we explore the methods and key metrics for measuring how innovation contributes to your organization's growth.

Setting the Stage for Measurement

### 2. **Baseline Assessment**

* **Benchmark Data**: Gather historical data to establish a baseline against which you can measure the impact of your innovation initiatives.

* **Control Groups**: In some cases, use control groups to isolate the effects of innovation from other factors.

* **Employee Stories**: Collect anecdotes and stories from employees to illustrate the positive changes brought about by innovation.

Continuous Improvement
----------------------

Measuring the impact of innovation is not a one-time endeavor; it's an ongoing process:
